Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins) implementing functionality
impossible or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities.
For example, cd, break, continue, and exec cannot be implemented outside
of the shell because they directly manipulate the shell itself.
The history, getopts, kill, or pwd builtins, among others, could be implemented
in separate utilities, but they are more convenient to use as builtin commands...

minishell

MiniShell will introduce you to the world of shells, which provide a convenient
text interface to interact with your system. Shells might seem very easy
to understand but have very specific and defined behaviour in almost every
single case, most of which will need to be handled properly.

### Prerequisites

Your shell needs to do a bunch of stuff, so just make sure you don't do the following stuff:

    Have very spaghetti code which makes adding stuff in the future very hard,
	as doing it properly will make it easier to do projects like 21sh and 42sh;
    Wildcard and priority support will take you another month at the least,
	if you want to do them, make sure you have the according amount of time to do them;
    Do not leak memory and leak file descriptors (also not in your child processes
	on command execution);
    Your shell must not crash in any scenario, its a shell, the only possible interaction
	 you have with your OS, dont let it crash as then you shall be doomed.

Getting started

#### There is a github repository that obeys the order of proceedings pretty nicely:
	https://github.com/Swoorup/mysh
    Please make sure to do a lexer -> parser -> expander -> executor
	to make your life easier.
	Here is a solid start. (PDF: Chapter5-WritingYourOwnShell)
    Make sure that you understand the shell syntax (POSIX link above)
